## Supported links

Links to these website will cause an automatic reply with either an image/video attachment or a rich embed.

### Videos

Videos and some images from posts, shorts, reels, stories, etc are attached in chat as if uploaded directly to Discord.

- Facebook
- iFunny
- Instagram
- Reddit
- TikTok

#### Other

Using the message context menu command (Apps > Embed media)
will cause the bot to attempt to download media from any (including unrecognised) links using [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp).

### Rich embeds

For multimedia social websites where text is often the primary content,
the bot replies with links to existing "embed fixer" services which
usually provide text content, author name, number of likes and comments, and improved image and video embeds.

- Bluesky (via [bskye.app](https://bskye.app))
- Twitter (via [fxtwitter.com](https://fxtwitter.com))

### Installation

Clone the repository:
```

Then create a `.env` file with the following contents:
```

FFMPEG_MAX_CONCURRENCY=4
FFMPEG_TIMEOUT=5m

Create a Discord application and bot **with the message content privileged intent enabled** and paste the token into the `.env` file.

Also, set the other environment variables:

- `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID`: the client ID of the Discord application
- `DOWNLOAD_DIR`: the directory which is served by a web server (e.g. `/var/www/html/videos`) where videos will be downloaded to
- `HOST`: the web server URL, which must end with a `/` (e.g. `https://example.com/videos/`)

Install Node.js dependencies:
```bash
npm i
```
Compile:
```bash
npm run build
```


Download `yt-dlp`:
```bash
curl -o /usr/bin/yt-dlp https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp/releases/latest/download/yt-dlp
```

And then [install `ffmpeg`](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html).

Finally, register the commands:
```bash
node scripts/commands
```
