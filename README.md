# MediaHelper

This is a fork of the popular [Media Helper](https://github.com/eartharoid/discord-media-helper) repository but with some adjustments to make it easier to self-host, along with some UX enhancements and touch ups along the way!

This bot is currently under heavy development and is not production-ready, we do not recommend you try to run the code in the main branch for now. Instead why not support the development by helping with issues or donating with the links on the sidebar?
